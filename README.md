# marketing_mix_modeling (MMM)

### In a marketing mix model, we embeded three types of marketing variable transformations in the modeling process to better describe relationship between marketing variables and business metrics:
1. saturation curve: To account for diminishing return of marketing activities.
2. decay/adstock: Advertising adstock is a term used for measuring the memory effect carried over from the time of first starting advertisements.
3. lag: A lag effect is used to represent the effect of a previous value of a lagged variable when there is some inherent ordering of the observations of this variable. 

### Two modeling methods implemented in this repo
* Ridge regression with concurrent marketing hyperparameter tunning ()
